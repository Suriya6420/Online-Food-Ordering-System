				<p> People coming from different places will not know exactly which restaurant will be good. They need to roam here and there in order to get a good restaurant.It would be very interesting to develop an application which will be able to manage the restaurant as well as store the details of the food items that are ordered by the customers. This application will also help to maintain the details of the home deliveries of the food items that have been ordered by the customers and the day to day activities of the restaurant.
